## Introduction 

In 1992, Peterson and Simkus presented research showing that educational level did not unexpectedly influence a more "clever" listening to music but rather the diversity of tastes. What is the situation today? In the era where digital technology allows everyone to have access to a range of styles that is growing every day, it seems possible to see the reflection of such a great diversity.  A precise analysis of tastes can be proposed, by trying to find trends in different subgroups of one larger pot, namely students. In "La stratification sociale des go√ªts musicaux" Philippe Coulangeon suggests that "Since music is not strictly speaking part of the common foundation of school culture, it is indeed a field in which we expect to see the influence of primary groups: family environment, peer groups, ethnic communities." (Coulangeon, p.4). Since the 1980s, the theories of a Bourdieuian logic that correlated musical tastes with social origin - linking "clever" musical genres to the upper classes - have been challenged by studies that show that the diversity of musical genres tends to evolve in the upper social classes. (Coulangeon, p.4)
As university students are part of the higher cultural class, they constitute a panel of choice to observe the diversity of musical choices. 

We would like to apply such a study to a group of students belonging to different institutions. It would then be possible to find, for example, whether the so-called technical studies are correlated with the kinds of music listened to or not, but also whether this kind depends on the different fields of study. Other influential factors, such as previous musical experience, age or national background should be also taken into account. If enough people take place in this small study, it could be a good reference for another similar future study (like 5-10 years from now), to see how the trends have moved around since today.

## Methodology and dataset

In this work we will pass a quantitative Google Form questionnaire with 2 open and few closed questions.
First, we ask the participants to provide some basic information about themselves like age and gender. The participants are going to be grouped by their study subject (roughly corresponding to a section/department at EPFL or Unil). Preliminary, these are: basic sciences, architecture and civil engineering, computer science, social sciences, and economics. The sample size will be around 50 people.
The first open-ended question will focus on musical genres. We will use the wording "What musical genres are you used to listening to? Unlike questions on "the preferred genre of music", this formulation makes it possible to eliminate "legitimizing effects" (Coulangean, p. 7). These effects are, for example, those of feeling forced to choose a musical genre valued in one's social environment (here a "learned" genre of music).
Choosing an open-ended question will eliminate the arbitrary effect of genre choices that, as we have seen, tend to be more and more diverse.
Another question will precise the first one and will be specifically about the songs participants listen to. The students will be able to freely submit their music in a convenient form. The obtained data will be processed manually. We will group the genres and the music given by the participants into a manageable number of categories.
Manual processing will allow us to avoid biases based of differing interpretations of genre names.
Our first statistical analysis will therefore be done on this open-ended question and will correspond to finding the percentage of citations of each genre in the population tested.
The analysis will be carried out on 500 university students from different faculties and fields of study. 
Still with a view to analysing diversity, we will carry out a second test to try to discover the possible correspondence between the number of genres listened to most often and the category of the study programme. In his study Phillippe Coulangeon had shown that students were a part of his sample to give several names of musical genres against a habit of only one genre for the majority of his sample. 
We will then try to find out if, by not giving any genre limits, there are significant differences between the number of genre given within our sample containing only university students. For this purpose we will use the independence test of the X2. 
The third part of our statistical analysis will be to cross-reference the results of the diversity of musical genres with university courses. For this, we will use the multiple correspondence analysis. 

The survey will be completely prepared for the next milestone.
