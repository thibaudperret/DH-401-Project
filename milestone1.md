# Research Question

In 1992, Peterson and Simkus presented research showing that educational level did not unexpectedly influence a more "clever" listening to music but 
rather the diversity of tastes. What is the situation today? In the era where digital technology allows everyone to have access to a range of styles 
that is growing every day, it seems possible to see the reflection of such a great diversity.  A precise analysis of tastes can be proposed, by trying
to find trends in different subgroups of one larger pot, namely students. In "La stratification sociale des goûts musicaux" Philippe Coulangeon suggests
that "Since music is not strictly speaking part of the common foundation of school culture, it is indeed a field in which we expect to see the influence 
of primary groups: family environment, peer groups, ethnic communities." (Coulangeon, p.4). We would like to apply such a study to a group of students 
belonging to two different institutions: UNIL and EPFL. It would then be possible to find, for example, whether the so-called technical studies are 
correlated with the kinds of music listened to or not, but also whether this kind depends on the different fields of study. Other influential factors,
such as previous musical experience, age or national background should be also taken into account. If enough people take place in this small study, it 
could be a good reference for another similar future study (like 5-10 years from now), to see how the trends have moved around since today.

# Methods

For this research, we will use an online questionnaire that we will send to students at both universities as in the study of Carolyn Spinelli. We will try 
to represent in our research as much diversity as possible in terms of styles by offering in our questionnaire a wide variety of choices. Students will be
differentiated by their different fields of study in order to see if there is a regularity in each field, as well as a distinction between gender and age
of participants. The questionnaire will be done as a website where participants could fill out a short survey and indicate how much time they spend listening
to one genre weekly. We would also like to encourage people to share the music they listen too directly with titles, links, playlists or their streaming profiles.

The data we will get will be the results of the study. In the meantime before next milestone, we can try to focus on developing a good questionnaire that
would not require useless information and that would not take too much time (as most people answer short questionnaires much rather than long ones). We 
can also start to think about the kind of segregation we want to apply in order to find trends in the results. 

# First draft of survey questions

Some of the question that can be featured on the questionnaire:
1. Background information (age, gender, section, country of origin)
2. Do you have musical experience, what kind of?
3. Would you describe yourself as a music enthusiast / audiophile?
4. How many hours do you spent on music per day?
5. When do you often listen to music (library, commute etc.)?
6. What genres do you listen to (options provided)
7. Do you have a favorite genre, which one?
8. Do you have a favorite musician, who?
9. Do you go to concerts?
